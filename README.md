# WearOS To-Do list

A To-Do list app for WearOS, that uses an existing Notion database as a task list.

## How to use

- Connect it with a Notion database (It will use the title and a checkbox column)
- List the tasks in your WearOS device
- Mark tasks as done. Marked tasks will remain disabled in the list until you update it

## Future roadmap

More backends may be added (Notion, GitHub... Ideas are welcome).
